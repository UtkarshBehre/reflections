Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. It makes the directory a git repository containing all the meta data inside a .git folder
which is supposed to record all the changes we make in the repository in the future.
We need to do this so that it can track all the changes and save all commits whenever we 
think we made good amount of changes in our code.

Q2, How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?
A. Staging area is the middle ground b/w the working directory and the git repository. It
offers u to have a customizable holder for our changes as we would like to tweeg with and 
helps out in maintaining order before making any changes to the repository itself.

Q3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A. We can check the diff b/w staging area and repo using git --staged and it'll show us
what are we going to commit exactly so we can double check before commiting. There maybe
other changes there in our working directory but that will be ignored during this process.

Q4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?
A. Some situations in where branches would be helpful can be 
1. experiments
2. suggestion
3. proposal
4. working simultaneously
5. have an active branch different from main.
6. compartmentalize.
7. can easily jump b/w branches to continue other sections of work anytime.

Branches will help out in keeping  the main branch with high production quality keeping 
everything clean for public to see.
