Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. It makes the directory a git repository containing all the meta data inside a .git folder
which is supposed to record all the changes we make in the repository in the future.
We need to do this so that it can track all the changes and save all commits whenever we 
think we made good amount of changes in our code.

Q2, How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?
A. Staging area is the middle ground b/w the working directory and the git repository. It
offers u to have a customizable holder for our changes as we would like to tweeg with and 
helps out in maintaining order before making any changes to the repository itself.
