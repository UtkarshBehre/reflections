Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. Whenever there is a change that is really simple change in a readme file or so.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. We might not want let git pull changes automatically coz we might be working on something
that doesnt require and updates from remote repository. So manual pull will allow us to 
finish our work then pull after we are all checked out.
