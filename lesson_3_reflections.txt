Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. Whenever there is a change that is really simple change in a readme file or so.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. We might not want let git pull changes automatically coz we might be working on something
that doesnt require and updates from remote repository. So manual pull will allow us to 
finish our work then pull after we are all checked out.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
A. We'll use forks to copy some person's repository to our own account, use clones to copy
a repository from our account on github to our local system or copy a repository from one 
location to the other, and use branches to to make seperate branches inside a repository 
on our local system.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A. It'll benefit in commits locally addressing to the origin/master stored locally. So that
when we git fetch and our origin/master updates to the remote origin then we can simply 
merge without having any doubt about where to merge or at what point did we make our own
master.
